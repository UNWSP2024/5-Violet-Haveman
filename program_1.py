# Program #1: Kilometer Converter
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, 
# then converts that distance to miles.  The conversion formula is as follows:  
# Miles = kilometers x 0.6214.   
# The conversion must be done as a function with input and output.


def kilometer_conversion(kilometers):    
    miles = 0.0

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print('in main')
        # Get User Input
    def kilometer_converter(n1, n2):
        miles = n1 * n2
    kilo = float(input('Please enter the distance (Kilometers):'))
    conversion_number = 0.6214
        # Call kilometer_conversion, don't forget to pass in the kilometer parameter!
    kilometer_converter(kilo, conversion_number)
        # Display the miles
    print ('Distance in Miles:', miles)

    # Return the variable to the calling function
    return miles

#### This piece of the code has been done for you,
#### you only need to worry about the actual kilometer
#### conversion logic in the kilometer_conversion function
